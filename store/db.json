We started out with four people, and today we’re a company of about 50 spread out across 32 different cities around the world. Our headquarters is in Chicago, but everyone at Basecamp is free to live and work wherever they want. Many of us love working remotely – we literally wrote the book on remote working!\nWe’re designers, programmers, tinkerers, writers, speakers, bikers, engineers, runners, developers, chefs, analysts, campers, musicians, filmmakers, knitters, hikers, authors, photographers, pilots, race car drivers, readers, travelers, gardeners, volunteers, parents, and hard workers.\n2016 marks our 17th year in business, yet we feel like we’re just getting started. For our first 15 years we were called 37signals. We changed our name to Basecamp in 2014 to reflect our focus on our most popular product (coincidently named Basecamp). \nOver the years we’ve been fortunate to earn the repeat business of thousands of customers including some of the world’s largest - and smallest - companies. It’s rare that a business tool is equally popular with the big guys and the small guys, but Basecamp is that kind of tool. Freelancers, small shops, mid-sized companies, and multinationals all rely on Basecamp.\nIf you run in tech circles, you’ve surely heard of Ruby on Rails. Over the past decade, Rails has become one of the world’s most popular programming frameworks. Sites like Twitter, and GitHub, and Shopify, and hundreds of thousands more all run on Rails.\nThe first Rails app, however, was our very own Basecamp. Rails was invented in 2003 by David Heinemeier Hansson, a partner here at Basecamp. Today Rails is as vibrant as ever, and still at the heart of Basecamp. Many of Rails modern innovations start as experiments inside Basecamp.\nTreating people right is fundamental to how we do business. We treat our customers as we’d want to be treated, we treat each other like family, and we treat ourselves to a good day’s work and a good night’s sleep.\nOur goals have always been the same: Have fun, do exceptional work, build the best product in the business, experiment, pay attention to the details, treat people right, tell the truth, have a positive impact on the world around us, give back, and keep learning.\nWe’re also big believers in business 101. We don’t spend more than we earn, we don’t waste money on things that don’t matter, we don’t give away everything for free and hope we’ll figure it out before we run out of cash. We’re in business to stay in business, and we have 15 profitable years in a row to back it up.\n                ",

Whether your current support system needs a tune up, or you just need someone to handle your help desk, The Yeomen are here for you. Let us know how we can help!  🙂\nJim Coe founded The Yeomen in the summer of 2013. Since then, we’ve grown to a team of 23 on three continents supporting a variety of languages. We are building a globally-distributed team to provide extended hours of service while ensuring that our staff can work a normal day. The Yeomen is committed to the happiness of our employees.\nGood community support transcends context, so we work with a variety of companies. Some sell physical products and software while others provide platforms for expression and empowerment. Still others aggregate news and market information to better inform their audience. All of them see the value of making sure their clients are well cared for.\nThe Yeomen are strong advocates of community. We believe the empathy and engagement that we invest in our customers should be reflected in our own workspace. Teamwork is the core of how we operate. We collaborate with one another, work together to solve problems, and take equal share in our successes. We celebrate and embrace diverse personalities, encourage social interaction, and welcome opportunities for our own team members to engage with each other’s insights and ideas. We also like our fun. If you can speak in gifs and emoticons, then you may be a good fit for our community.\nThinking about joining us? Here are some of the best things about being on our team:\n• You can work from your home, at a coffee shop, by the pool, or pretty much anywhere you can find WiFi.\n• Our salaries and benefits are competitive for our industry.\n• You get a shiny MacBook and all kinds of software tools for making your work time productive and enjoyable.\n• Our clients are awesome, and so are the people that use their products.\nWe live in a never-ending stream of meme references.\n                ",
